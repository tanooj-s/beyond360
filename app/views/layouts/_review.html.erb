        <em>"Beyond 360 travels has been taking care of my travels since 2007. We are a group of senior citizens (14 to 16) and we have travelled to Australia  New Zealand, Croatia, Baku, Vietnam Cambodia, Machu Pichu and recently to South Africa. The agency has arranged everything from visa and tickets to hotels, excursions and all local transport. It has always been a very positive experience. On a recent trip, when I had a fall, the agency promptly arranged my flight back home. All details were taken care of."</em>

        <em>"I first dealt with Beyond 360 in 2012. Since then our family of 4 have been to Italy, Spain, Kenyaand Tanzania, Alaska cruise and Rocky Mountains tour. A very good safari trip and the Rocky mountain trip were suggested by the agency. Very efficient service and excellent itinerary suggested. Now I donâ€™t bother booking elsewhere."</em>
